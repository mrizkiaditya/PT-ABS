Geotextile Woven production process is ISO standard, has good UV resistance and the basic material for making it is usually Polypropylene (PP). To make visualization easier, this Woven Geotextile is similar to a rice sack (not a burlap one) but is black in color.",
    "geowov2" => "The function of Woven Geotextile is as a subgrade stabilization material (especially soft subgrade), because this type of Geotextile has a higher tensile strength than Non Woven Geotextile (about 2 times for the same gramation or weight per m2). The way Geotextile Woven works is a membrane effect, which only relies on tensile strength, so it does not reduce local settlement (differential settlement) due to soft or poor subgrade.",
    "geowov3" => "The most popular lately is the application of geotextile on the roof of the house that doubles as a garden. The geotextile layer on the garden on the roof of the house serves to protect the seepage of groundwater, but also maintains soil moisture so that the plants planted on the roof of your house continue to grow like in the front yard of the house.",
    "geowov4" => "Geotextile materials are widely used in road construction projects on unstable land, for example, when a road is to be built on land that used to be a swamp, then before asphalt, the part of the land that will be made the road is first given a layer of geotextile, then given a second layer , namely soil along with a layer of gravel. In addition, the installation of a geotextile layer is also carried out on the retaining layer of the railroad tracks, before the gravel layer, first of all, the soil is first coated with geotextile material and then covered with a pile of gravel. Then the railroad tracks were installed, and finally the rails were installed."
